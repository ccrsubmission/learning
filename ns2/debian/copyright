	the code base was relicensed to a collection of GNU GPL compatible, 
	free software licenses.  See
	http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html
	for a collection of definitions of these terms.

	Note:  See also the COPYRIGHTS file in this directory regarding the
	copyrights on the ns-2 software.

	The majority of software licenses use following types of licenses:
	i) GNU GPL, with specific exception allowing the linking of the GPL
	covered software with other software licensed with clauses in conflict with
	the GPL (see below)
	ii) original Berkeley-style licenses with advertising clauses
	iii) modified Berkeley-style licenses (w/o advertising clause)

	Other software licenses (e.g., Apache 2.0) also exist.

	If you are considering the contribution of code to ns-2, please pick
	a GNU GPL-compatible software license.  If you prefer GNU GPL, please
	add the specific exception text listed below.

	If you are considering the use of ns-2, consider that derivative
	works or redistribution may be governed by the terms of the software
	licenses used herein, including the GNU GPL and Berkeley-style
	licenses with advertising clauses.

	terms of the GNU GPL for this module and the licenses of the
	other code concerned, provided that you include the source code of
	that other code when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of
	source code.

	are not obligated to grant this special exception for their
	modified versions; it is their choice whether to do so.  The GNU
